## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.
### For ECLIPSE IDE:
1. Clone
2. click->file-> Open Projects from Filesystem -> Directory->Point it to the project's root folder

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources.
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies.
- `src/test`: package for code testing.
- `src/samples`: package containing runnable frames of each component without DB access.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
